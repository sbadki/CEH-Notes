Objective
The objective of this lab is to extract information about the target system that includes, but not limited to:

- Network vulnerabilities
- IP and Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) ports and services that are listening
- Application and services configuration errors/vulnerabilities
- The OS version running on computers or devices
- Applications installed on computers
- Accounts with weak passwords
- Files and folders with weak permissions
- Default services and applications that may have to be uninstalled
- Mistakes in the security configuration of common applications
- Computers exposed to known or publicly reported vulnerabilities
  Overview of Vulnerability Assessment
  A vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to compromise the security of the system. It is frequently a security loophole that enables an attacker to enter the system by bypassing user authentication. There are generally two main causes for vulnerable systems in a network, software or hardware misconfiguration and poor programming practices. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various types of attacks on organizational resources.

Lab Tasks
Ethical hackers or pen testers use numerous tools and techniques to collect information about the underlying vulnerability in a target system or network. Recommended labs that will assist you in learning various vulnerability assessment techniques include:

- List itemPerform vulnerability research with vulnerability scoring systems and databases
    1. Perform vulnerability research in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
    2. 	Perform vulnerability research in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
    3. 	Perform vulnerability research in National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- List itemPerform vulnerability assessment using various vulnerability assessment tools
    1. Perform vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS
    2. 	Perform vulnerability scanning using Nessus
          Created N/w scan policy first
          Create New scan - using used defined policy in earlier step
          The report regarding selected vulnerability **SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)** appears with detailed information such as plugin details, risk information, vulnerability information, reference information and the solution, and output, as shown in the screenshot.
    3. 	Perform web servers and applications vulnerability scanning using CGI Scanner Nikto

Nessus scan - with Firewall ON&OFF
The scan results for the target machine before and after the Windows Firewall was enabled are the same, thereby indicating that the target system is vulnerable to attack even if the Firewall is enabled.
